Uncaught cannot call methods on button prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'

$('#testBtn').button();          // initialize button
$('#testBtn').button('refresh'); // then call refresh

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'removeClass' of undefined
Seems to be related to the theme 'b' or whatever and could just be an idiotic bug.
